Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

- New features should be discussed in great length using [issues](https://github.com/TehSeph/NetherFoundation/issues) before a PR is submitted.
- Other than the `.editorconfig` file there is no code style enforced, but please keep all code clean and documented.
- _DO NOT SUBMIT PULL REQUESTS TO ANY BRANCHES OTHER THAN MASTER!!!_
- The devs reserve the right to close any PR without having to give any reason, especially if it fails to meet the above requirements.
